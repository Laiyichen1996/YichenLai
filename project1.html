      <div class="b"><br><br><b>Site</b>: Gunan Street, Dingshu Town, Yixing City, Jiangsu, China
        <br><b>Status</b>: Course Assignment, Individual Work

    <div class="c">It represents my interpretation of the local region in China called “Jiangnan”. In the project, I
      combined the tile roofs in the painting, Village, of Mr. Wu Guanzhong, a famous artist in China, with the style of
      gardens in Jiangnan. With slanted roof in Jiangnan style, the size of every individual building is kept within an
      appropriate range, so they can be better integrated into the local environment. Also, people can appreciate the
      buildings in the balance between public and private areas thanks to the corridors which blur the boundaries
      between the rooms and the outside world. Besides the local characteristics, the steel-wood structure in the
      large-span concert hall and glass curtain walls allow people to have different experiences from traditional
      architectures. By doing so, my work can take into account new technologies while revitalizing regional
      characteristics.

    <div class="d">Standing on the top of the mountain, like the long film of the movie, sweeping from the left to the
      right, the houses surrounded by mountains and rivers grow into an orderly level of texture, each of which looks
      like a connection. The roof looks like a continuous stretch, falling from each other, and there is a picturesque
      in the painting of Wu Guanzhong.</div>
    <div class="e">The building layout continues the directionality of the horizontal texture of the site, and the
      volumes on the north and east sides are reduced to fit the scale of the surrounding buildings.</div>

      studios are placed here.</div>
    <div class="j">Garden is an extension and complement of this public building, the living space of people is expanded
      through the semi-outdoor platforms on the first and second floors.</div>

    <div class="k">The traditional buildings around the site are made of wood, so the main material of the project is
      wood, which hopes to have the same affinity as traditional buildings. However, t he compression resistance of the
      wood column is poor, so the steel-wood structure is selected, and the column is steel, and the other members are
      in the form of wood.</div>
